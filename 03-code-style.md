# Code Style and Coding Standards

## Naming Philosophy

### 1. Descriptive Over Concise
**Principle**: Names must be self-documenting, prefer clarity over brevity

**Guidelines**:
- Use full words instead of abbreviations: `configuration` instead of `config`
- Function names should describe what they do: `validateUserInput()` instead of `validate()`
- Variable names should describe what they contain: `userEmail` instead of `email`
- Boolean variables should be questions: `isValid`, `hasPermission`, `canExecute`

### 2. Consistent Naming Patterns
**Variables and Functions**:
- Use consistent casing convention throughout project
- Prefix/suffix patterns for related functionality
- Namespace-like naming for utilities: `log_info()`, `log_error()`

**Files and Directories**:
- Consistent case convention (kebab-case, camelCase, snake_case)
- Descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Group related files with common prefixes

### 3. Context-Aware Naming
**Principles**:
- Names should make sense in their context
- Avoid redundant prefixes when context is clear
- Use domain-specific terminology consistently
- Abbreviations only for well-known industry standards

## Code Structure Patterns

### 1. Function Design Philosophy
**Single Responsibility**:
- Each function should do one thing well
- Function length should be readable in single screen
- Clear input/output contracts
- Minimal side effects

**Error Handling**:
- Functions should handle their own errors when possible
- Return error indicators rather than silent failures
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Document error conditions

### 2. Variable Management
**Scope Management**:
- Declare variables close to where they're used
- Use const/readonly when values don't change
- Minimize global state
- Clear variable lifetime management

**State Tracking**:
- Use explicit state variables for complex operations
- Boolean flags for status tracking
- Arrays/collections for accumulating results
- Clear state initialization and cleanup

### 3. Control Flow Patterns
**Early Returns**:
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Guard clauses for validation
- Clear success path through code
- Minimal cognitive complexity

**Loop and Iteration**:
- Clear loop termination conditions
- Avoid complex nested loops
- Extract loop bodies into functions when complex
- Iterator patterns for collection processing

## Documentation Standards

### 1. Code Comments Philosophy
**When to Comment**:
- **Why** decisions were made, not **what** code does
- Complex algorithms that aren't immediately obvious
- Business logic requirements
- Workarounds and their reasons

**Comment Quality**:
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use consistent comment formatting
- Avoid obvious comments
- Focus on maintainer's perspective

### 2. Function Documentation
**Required Elements**:
- Purpose and behavior description
- Parameter descriptions and types
- Return value specifications
- Error conditions and handling
- Usage examples for complex functions

### 3. File and Module Documentation
**Header Comments**:
- File purpose and responsibility
- Dependencies and requirements
- Author and maintenance info
- Usage guidelines

## Formatting Standards

### 1. Consistency Principles
**Visual Structure**:
- Consistent indentation throughout project
- Clear section separations
- Aligned assignments when beneficial
- Consistent spacing around operators

**Line Management**:
- Reasonable line length limits
- Logical line breaks for readability
- Consistent continuation patterns
- Clear statement termination

### 2. Code Organization Within Files
**Section Organization**:
- Logical grouping of related functions
- Clear separation between sections
- Consistent ordering patterns
- Related code co-located

**Import/Dependency Management**:
- Clear dependency declarations
- Logical grouping of imports
- Minimize circular dependencies
- Version-specific requirements documented

## Error Handling Style

### 1. Error Communication
**User-Facing Errors**:
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Contextual information for debugging
- Consistent error formatting
- Escalation paths for complex issues

**Developer-Facing Errors**:
- Detailed error context
- Stack traces when helpful
- Error categorization
- Recovery suggestions

### 2. Error Recovery Patterns
**Graceful Degradation**:
- Fallback strategies for non-critical failures
- Partial success reporting
- Continue-on-error options
- Clear failure boundaries

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Efficiency Patterns
**Resource Management**:
- Explicit resource cleanup
- Avoid unnecessary computations
- Cache expensive operations
- Memory usage awareness

**Algorithm Choice**:
- Appropriate data structures for use case
- Consider time/space complexity
- Profile before optimizing
- Readability vs performance trade-offs

### 2. Scalability Patterns
**Design for Growth**:
- Algorithms that scale with data size
- Configurable resource limits
- Modular designs for horizontal scaling
- Performance monitoring hooks

## Security Considerations

### 1. Input Validation
**Validation Patterns**:
- Validate all external inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use allowlists rather than blocklists
- Fail securely on validation errors

### 2. Output Security
**Data Exposure**:
- Minimize information leakage in errors
- Secure logging practices
- Sanitize output data
- Protect sensitive information
