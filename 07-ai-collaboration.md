# AI Collaboration Philosophy and Best Practices

## Core Principles for Working with AI

### 1. Context-Driven Development
**Philosophy**: Always provide comprehensive context before asking for implementation or analysis.

**Why**: AI performs exponentially better when given proper context rather than working from isolated requests.

**Best Practices**:
- Share relevant existing code patterns before asking for new implementations
- Provide project history and established conventions (e.g., "xem thử sample của install.sh")
- Use attachments and file references to give AI full picture
- Reference previous successful patterns ("theo pattern của oh-my-zsh")

### 2. Iterative Refinement Approach
**Philosophy**: Start with broad planning, then iteratively refine through feedback loops.

**Pattern Observed**:
1. Initial comprehensive planning (RISO-BOOTSTRAP-PLAN.md)
2. User feedback on real-world constraints ("không cần template, mỗi dự án mỗi khác")
3. AI adapts and simplifies based on feedback
4. Further refinement through additional insights (git stash analysis)

**Best Practices**:
- Build plans incrementally rather than trying to perfect everything upfront
- Be explicit about what works vs what doesn't in real usage
- Use "Continue: 'Continue to iterate?'" pattern for ongoing refinement

### 3. Problem-First, Solution-Second
**Philosophy**: Clearly articulate the problem before jumping to solutions.

**Examples from Session**:
- "việc nhiều feature cùng thực hiện cái việc gọi apt trùng lặp thì có tốn quá nhiều thời gian không" → Led to multi-OS optimization strategy
- User pointing out over-engineering issues → Led to simplified conditional approach

**Best Practices**:
- Start conversations with problem statement
- Explain constraints and real-world limitations
- Let AI suggest multiple approaches rather than prescribing specific solutions

### 4. Leverage Existing Patterns
**Philosophy**: Always look for proven patterns before creating new ones.

**Pattern Observed**: "trong git stash tôi đang cất feature ohmyzsh"
- Study existing implementations in the codebase
- Extract proven patterns (multi-OS detection, test architecture)
- Adapt rather than rebuild from scratch
- Real implementations show edge cases and complexity

**Best Practices**:
- Reference specific files/locations when available
- Explain what patterns to extract ("multiple OS support", "test suite model")
- Use existing work as learning material, not starting templates
- Validate new solutions against proven approaches

## Context Management Excellence

### 1. Reference Concrete Examples
**Effective Pattern**: Point to specific implementations
```bash
git stash show stash@{0} --name-only
git stash show stash@{0} scenarios.json
```

**Why More Effective Than Abstract Descriptions**:
- Concrete code is more precise than theoretical concepts
- Shows real-world complexity and edge cases
- Provides working solutions with proven track record
- Eliminates ambiguity in implementation details

### 2. Separate Universal vs. Contextual Knowledge
**Pattern**: Clear boundaries between reusable insights and project specifics

**Universal** (belongs in coding philosophy):
- AI collaboration patterns
- Problem-solving approaches
- Context management strategies
- Communication effectiveness principles

**Contextual** (belongs in project context):
- DevContainer feature specifications
- Technical implementation decisions
- Project-specific constraints
- Domain knowledge and requirements

**Why Critical**: Prevents mixing timeless principles with situational details

### 3. Progress Documentation Strategy
**Pattern**: Track both technical progress and learning insights

**Technical Progress**: What was built, decided, implemented
**Learning Insights**: What patterns worked, what didn't, why
**Decision Context**: Constraints and trade-offs that shaped choices

**Benefits**:
- Enables effective handoffs between sessions
- Captures institutional knowledge
- Helps replicate successful collaboration patterns
- Provides learning material for future AI interactions

## Pattern Recognition from Successful Sessions

### 1. Reference-Driven Development
**Observed Pattern**: Using existing implementations as learning material
- User showed sample install.sh → AI adapted the logging and structure patterns
- Git stash analysis of oh-my-zsh → AI extracted multi-OS and testing patterns
- "tôi chỉ muốn nó làm việc cơ bản thôi" → AI focused on essential functionality

**Why Effective**:
- Concrete examples eliminate ambiguity
- Proven patterns reduce risk of over-engineering
- Real-world implementations show necessary complexity
- Faster convergence on practical solutions

### 2. Constraint-Driven Innovation
**Pattern**: Best solutions emerge from clearly stated limitations
- "không cần template, mỗi dự án mỗi khác" → Conditional setup approach
- "việc nhiều feature cùng thực hiện cái việc gọi apt trùng lặp" → Multi-OS optimization
- Performance concerns → Simplified architecture decisions

**Key Insight**: Constraints are creative catalysts, not limitations

### 3. Iterative Refinement with Reality Checks
**Session Evolution**:
1. Comprehensive plan (957 lines, theoretical completeness)
2. User feedback (practical constraints, real usage patterns)
3. Simplified approach (40 focused tasks, conditional logic)
4. Validation (proven patterns from oh-my-zsh analysis)

**Pattern**: Start broad, narrow based on real constraints, validate with proven examples

## Communication Styles That Work

### 1. Direct Feedback Style
**Pattern**: "1. không cần template, 2. các bước setup kiểu như 4 5 6... nên là dạng kiểm tra, 3. bạn cần phải làm gọn gàng hơn"

**Why Effective**:
- Numbered, specific points
- Clear about what to remove vs what to change
- Actionable feedback

### 2. Context-Rich Requests
**Pattern**: "ngoài ra trong git stash tôi đang cất feature ohmyzsh, nó có support multiple os, và có mô hình test suite mà tôi muốn, hãy vào đó xem"

**Why Effective**:
- Provides specific location for reference
- Explains what to look for ("multiple OS support", "test suite model")
- Clear about purpose ("nhớ là chỉ xem thôi đừng có pop stash")
- Leverages existing work as learning material

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
**Pattern**: Start with overview → Add details → Refine based on feedback

**Example from Riso Bootstrap Session**:
1. Initial comprehensive plan (957 lines, 159 tasks)
2. User feedback: "không cần template, mỗi dự án mỗi khác"
3. Simplified to conditional approach (~40 focused tasks)
4. Added multi-OS insights from oh-my-zsh analysis

**Why Effective**:
- Prevents overwhelming AI with too much information at once
- Allows for course correction before deep implementation
- Builds understanding incrementally
- Real-world constraints shape the solution

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Assumption-Heavy Requests
**Wrong**: "Make it better"
**Right**: "The current approach has X problem because Y constraint, consider Z alternatives"

### 2. Solution-Locked Thinking
**Wrong**: "Implement it exactly like this..."
**Right**: "I need to solve X problem, here are constraints Y, what approaches work?"

### 3. Context-Free Implementation
**Wrong**: Starting implementation without showing existing patterns
**Right**: "Here's how we do similar things in the project (attachment), apply same pattern"

## AI Collaboration Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Setting
1. Share project overview and goals
2. Provide relevant existing code/patterns
3. Explain constraints and requirements
4. Reference similar successful implementations

### Phase 2: Collaborative Planning
1. AI proposes comprehensive approach
2. Human provides reality-check feedback
3. Iterative refinement based on real-world usage
4. Validation against existing patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation Guidance
1. Break down into specific, manageable tasks
2. Reference proven patterns for each component
3. Regular check-ins for course correction
4. Document decisions and reasoning

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
1. Review against established best practices
2. Check for consistency with project patterns
3. Validate real-world applicability
4. Update documentation and context

## Principles for AI-Human Handoff

### 1. Always Leave Context Trails
- Document reasoning behind decisions
- Reference source patterns and inspirations
- Explain trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Update project context files appropriately

### 2. Separate Concerns Clearly
- Project-specific context → `.context/project/`
- General philosophy and patterns → `.context/coding-philosophy/`
- Implementation details → actual code files
- Planning and analysis → dedicated plan files

### 3. Make Decisions Explicit
- Don't assume AI will remember previous context
- Document key decisions in appropriate context files
- Reference successful patterns from the project
- Keep implementation and philosophy separate

## Success Metrics for AI Collaboration
